Problem Introduction:
Now, when you are sure that there are no cyclic dependencies in the given CS curriculum, you would like to
find an order of all courses that is consistent with all dependencies. For this, you find a topological ordering
of the corresponding directed graph.
<br/>
<br/>
Task: Compute a topological ordering of a given directed acyclic graph (DAG) with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges.
<br/>
<br/>
Input Format: See code for examples
<br/>
<br/>
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105, 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 105. The given graph is guaranteed to be acyclic.
<br/>
<br/>
Output Format: Output any topological ordering of its vertices. (Many DAGs have more than just one
topological ordering. You may output any of them.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)
